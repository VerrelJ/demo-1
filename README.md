TAXI FARE PREDICTION
====================

In this use case, We use Chicago Taxi Dataset that we obtained from Google Cloud BigQuery to predict fare of a taxi in Chicago.


For this use case, We use 5 different Regression models to compare which model trained well from the dataset that later will be used in the deployment. The model used are SVM, CatBoost, Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost.
